Parental Control AI SOW/PRFAQ - Hackathon
Sat, 12 Jul 25

## Project Overview
Develop a new "Parental Control AI" application for the hackathon
Target Age: Elementary school grades 1-4 (ages 6-10)
Combines AI learning support for children with parental control features

## Key Features

### AI Learning Support
- Children can ask questions about learning and research topics through chat-based AI
- Responses limited to age-appropriate content only
- Automatic detection of inappropriate question content

### Parent Notification System
- Problematic question content automatically notified to parents via AI
- Parents make approval/disapproval decisions
- Real-time oversight of child's digital interactions

### Control Mechanisms
- **Disapproval case**: Automatic Wi-Fi disconnection to block internet access
- **Approval case**: Notification sent to child's computer allowing continued operation
- Immediate response system for safety

## Problems We Solve

### Current AI Service Limitations
- Use by children under 12 is generally not recommended
- Ages 13-18 also require parental control
- **Source**: "Minimum Age: You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required in your country to consent to use our services. If you are under 18, you must have permission from your parent or legal guardian to use our services."
- Reality: Children are already using these services despite restrictions

### Parental Anxiety Relief
- Provides a safe environment for children to learn with AI
- Addresses the lack of appropriate monitoring and support mechanisms
- Goes beyond simple answer provision to support children's learning motivation, curiosity, and imagination

## Future Vision & User Settings

### Preparation for AI Collaboration Era
- Provides basic educational programs for AI utilization
- Teaches methods for human-AI collaboration
- Builds foundation for future digital literacy

### Target Users
- **Users**: Elementary school students (grades 1-4)
- **Customers**: Parents (both fathers and mothers can use with confidence)

### Educational Philosophy
- Nurtures appropriate relationship with AI technology
- Encourages critical thinking and digital responsibility
- Supports natural learning progression in AI-assisted environment
